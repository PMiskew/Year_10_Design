This extra help session involved helping a student materialize their work.  Once this was done we got their login and button bound to a function.  When the user hits hte login button the login display goes away and the section to log informaiton appears. 

Next Steps:

	- We want to simulate users and passwords using two parallel lists. 
	- We only want the login to work if there is a user name and password that are valid
	- We want to create a second function for register which creates a new user and password.  We need to check if the user is there. 
	- Create the display to collect information.  This will work very similarly to the login, but just add work out data to the users list. 

Bigger Idea:
	- With this project we are simulating a login.  Since we are storing the information locally if we reload the page or move to another page everything is lost.  

Strategy:
	- The nav bar links will take you to different pages that work independently of login. This is a good place to practice the ideas around Materialize and setting up teh page.
