This program demonstrates how to access and use a data set that is recieved and converted into a JSON. It explores a Tkinter setup and is designed to re-enforce ideas around loops and where they are useful. 

Data Collection:  
- This program requires a login screen that is collecting and storing user data
- This program requires the users to submit a list of personal belongings for valuation in local currency
- This program requires the user to indicate that they are travelling and to where.  In a real world context think of safety and security when sharing with the world where you are going and when you are not at home. There cases of people using Facebook information to tell when someone is not home and use this as an opportunity to break in. 

Data Access:
- This program requires access to the upto date value of world currencies

Data Modelling:
- None

API Used: https://fixer.io/
- This is a free API provided there are under 1000 pulls per month. It provides a valuation of currency relative to a selected currency.
