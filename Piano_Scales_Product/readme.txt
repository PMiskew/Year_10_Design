1. Why didn't you use a form?

The reason I didn't use a form is because when you submit a form the page gets reloaded. 
I wanted to update the page display and since I am reloading the page it gets set back to 
the original state with no scale. 


Stages: 

Stage 1:	HTML, CSS and JS Setup (INCLUDE CANVAS CUT AND PASTE CODE)
Stage 2:	Binding and accessing information
Stage 3:	Generating Results list
Stage 4:	Adding marks on keys and writting clearMarks
Stage 5: 	Updating keyboard with proper keys. 

Some Music Theory:

- There are 12 notes 
- A whole step (W) is moving up 2 notes
- A half step (H) is moving up 1 note
- To generate a scale we start at the root note

Major Scale
	W W H W W W H
Minor Scale
	W H W W H W W


For Example:
C Major Scale - W W H W W W H

    2         2      1     2        2        2      1
 X        X        X   X        X.       X.       X   X
"C","C#","D","D#","E","F","F#","G","G#","A","A#","B","C"
[C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C]

A Minor Scale - W H W W H W W
 X.       X   X.       X        X.  X.       X.       X
"A","A#","B","C","C#","D","D#","E","F","F#","G","G#","A"
[A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A]
