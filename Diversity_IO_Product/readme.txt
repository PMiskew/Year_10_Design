IMPORTANT:  This demo product uses an API that predicts ethnicity and gender using a predefined model.  This demo is meant to give an opportunity for students to critically question the API results and think about the larger question of how we use data to make predictions. 

THIS IS A BAD API - I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT EVER BE USED. Part of the reason we look at this example is to understand why it is so important to be critical in our use of APIs.  

Purpose:

The purpose of this simple product is
	- refresh basic web-development principles
	- Learn how to use the fetch then process with an API that processes data
	- Learn how to use the materialize API to make the design look better astetically. 


API's

In our course we frame API's in four catagories, even though this is not a standard API classification system and none is perfect. 

1. Documentation/Hidden API's 
	- This is the programming language you are using without realizing it. 
2. Front End API's
	- These are API's that are used to make things look good.  Some common web examples include Bootstrap and Materialize.  A python exam is pysimplegui which streamlines the process of developing a GUI using tkinter.
3. Data Access API's
	- These are sites where you are requesting and recieving, hopefully, data from some source.  An example of this would be the NASA open API https://api.nasa.gov/
4. Modelling API's
	- These are resources that are sending data back, but after performing an analysis on the data.  Data Access API's are the same in that information to indicate what to send, but the difference here is that there is a third party model being applied to the passed information.  Two examples are Diversity diversitydata.io and clarifai (https://www.clarifai.com/)

In this small project we use two

	- https://diversitydata.io/
